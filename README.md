# TinyML: A Compact Revolution in Engineering AI  

Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is the field of deploying **machine learning models on resource-constrained devices** such as microcontrollers, sensors, and IoT platforms.  
Unlike traditional ML that relies on powerful servers or cloud systems, TinyML enables **real-time, low-power, and on-device intelligence**, making AI accessible at the edge.  

### Why TinyML?  
- ⚡ **Ultra-low power consumption** – runs on batteries for months or years  
- 📦 **Compact models** – optimized through quantization, pruning, and compression  
- 🌍 **Wider reach** – brings AI to remote, low-connectivity environments  
- 🔒 **Privacy by design** – data stays on device, reducing dependence on cloud  

### Applications  
- Smart healthcare devices  
- Predictive maintenance in industry  
- Environmental monitoring with IoT  
- Human–computer interaction and wearables  
- Brain-inspired embedded AI
